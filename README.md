Opera upstreamtools
===================

A script to create [a web page](https://operasoftware.github.io/upstreamtools/) tracking
upstreamed code to the Chromium project from Opera.


Getting started
---------------

Get the source:

    git clone https://github.com/operasoftware/upstreamtools
    cd upstreamtools

Install the requirements (possibly inside a virtualenv):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Get the required upstream repositories:

    git clone --mirror https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git chromium.src.git
    git clone --mirror https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink.git chromium.blink.git
    git clone --mirror https://github.com/v8/v8.git v8.git

Generate the file:

    python generate_upstream_list.py > upstream.html


Updating the overview
---------------------

There's a simple script which should be able to do the work for you.  It will
generate the list, switch to the `gh-pages` branch and commit it.  If you run
it with the `push` argument it will even try to push it for you.

    ./update_overview.sh [push]


Updating the overview manually
------------------------------

Update the Git checkouts.

    for p in chromium.blink chromium.src v8; do git --git-dir=$p.git fetch; done

Generate the file, switch branch and check in there.

    python generate_upstream_list.py > upstream.html
    git checkout gh-pages
    mv upstream.html index.html
    git commit -m "Update upstream overview." index.html

NOTE: It should normally only add new entries. Check if it does something else.
If you did not clone the upstreames like mirrors, the master branch won't
always be poining at the newest point in history. You will have to do a `git
pull` or similar in your working directory.
